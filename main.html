	 <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the amount of time it takes to execute. It is a measure of how the execution time of an algorithm grows with the input size. In other words, time complexity helps us understand how the algorithm's performance scales as the size of the problem increases. An algorithm with a lower time complexity is considered more efficient, as it can handle larger inputs in a shorter amount of time.

    <p>
        Space Complexity is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It represents the maximum amount of memory required by the algorithm to complete its execution. In Big O notation, which is commonly used to express space complexity, we denote the upper bound of the space required. For example, if an algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it means the space required by the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a crucial consideration in optimizing algorithms, especially in situations where memory is limited.
